1) Analyses of previously published data on biodiversity and forest degradation at DTF territories and congruence between RS products and biodiversity information to describe habitat quality
2) Analyses of land management practices on forest degradation
3) Analyses on ecosystem services provision under different climate and forest cover scenarios with their economic valuations
